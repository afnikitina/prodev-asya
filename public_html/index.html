			<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
			<dl>
				<dt><h3>Week 1</h3></dt>
				<dd>The first week had exceeded my expectations in terms of pressure and intensity. I like both my instructors and my fellow bootcampers. Even though I am a shy person, I started feeling myself pretty comfortable in this environment by the middle of the first week. I am determined to gain as much knowledge as possible, master as many skills as I can, and make a successful transition to a new career</dd>
				<dt><h3>Week 2</h3></dt>
				<dd>It seems to me that the second week was tougher than the first one because of the amount of new information we’ve received. I am enjoying the process of learning/relearning and practicing coding, though. People around me are very nice. So, everything is good. I would love to preserve that feeling of enjoyment as I know that things will get extremely tough and demanding starting from week 4. I intend to up the time I spend studying and coding at home.</dd>
