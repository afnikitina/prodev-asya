			<h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
			<p>Hi, my name is Asya. I am currently training to become a professional web developer who will be equally fluent in both front- and end-back web development with an emphasis on the back-end web development. I already have a master’s degree in Computer Science. But attending the Deep Dive Coding Bootcamp adds the highly valuable hands-on experience to my background in computer science and makes me a better software development professional. Do you know by any chance someone who is hiring web developers right now?</p>

				<h3>Now</h3>

				<p>At the moment I feel lost and out of place a little bit. But at the same time I can see my goals very clearly and I know exactly how to get there. That is why I've chosen this picture. It reflects the state I am presently in.</p>

				<h3>In three years from now</h3>

				<p>In three years from now I hope I will have a job that I love and look forward to every day. I will be a respected member of a team and will know that I contribute substantially to success of the company.</p>

			<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
			<dl>
				<dt><h3>Week 1</h3></dt>
				<dd>The first week had exceeded my expectations in terms of pressure and intensity. I like both my instructors and my fellow bootcampers. Even though I am a shy person, I started feeling myself pretty comfortable in this environment by the middle of the first week. I am determined to gain as much knowledge as possible, master as many skills as I can, and make a successful transition to a new career</dd>
				<dt><h3>Week 2</h3></dt>
				<dd>It seems to me that the second week was tougher than the first one because of the amount of new information we’ve received. I am enjoying the process of learning/relearning and practicing coding, though. People around me are very nice. So, everything is good. I would love to preserve that feeling of enjoyment as I know that things will get extremely tough and demanding starting from week 4. I intend to up the time I spend studying and coding at home.</dd>
				<dt><h3>Week 3</h3></dt>
				<dd>This week has been great. The team that I have become a part of is great. We’ve already done a lot of initial work on our capstone project. The project itself is going to be challenging but fun, I believe. Incidentally, our project idea was mine ☺.️I’ve learn a lot of new stuff this week, which is also good. All in all, I am very happy about this bootcamp and how things are going so far. </dd>
				<dt><h3>Week 4</h3></dt>
				<dd>I love coding because when I am coding I feel creative and powerful. Those are wonderful feelings. As for my reflection on this week at Deep Dive Coding – this week was quite eventful. Among those events was my laptop died last Wednesday, so I lost some of precious time while setting up the development environment on my new laptop. I plan to catch up with what I missed today and tomorrow, so I should be good by Monday morning.</dd>
				<dt><h3>Week 5</h3></dt>
